This C# console application leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch current weather data for a specified location. It provides users information about temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Users can input the name of a city or specify the city's latitude and longitude coordinates to retrieve weather data. The fetched information is then displayed in the console interface in an easy-to-read format.

With this application, users can stay informed about the current weather conditions in any location supported by the OpenWeather API.
